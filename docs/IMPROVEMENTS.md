# Delta from upstream TIME

Improved TIME derives from `zqiao11/TIME` commit
`c11ed82c3eaf39e42e081e5995e7880a76f86cb9`. The initial source-only migration
consolidates reusable behavior from the former Improved repository at commit
`fd04c9f48034e2d7c604651ec23b2a177061900f`, including its final uncommitted
finite-coverage repair where that behavior belongs in the common layer.

- 2026-09-28 made the shared Seasonal baseline an independent artifact project
  at `seasonal/outputs/seasonal_naive/{inference,evaluations}` with
  experiment-owned logs. Producer and consumer paths no longer encode the
  unrelated `foundation_models/tasks` hierarchy.

## Runtime and lifecycle infrastructure

- Added the shared `computed` task state: outer launch interruption changes
  only unfinished `running` tasks, recovery finalizes computed tasks without
  repeating their computation, and consumers still select only `completed`
  inputs. Added compact dependency references so child caches include only
  stage-relevant producer identity instead of recursive manifests.
- Added the common finite-validation mask used by active selecting children:
  both context and future need finite support; an empty usable set is handled
  by each experiment's explicit default rather than by this shared helper.
- Added the `TIME_DATA_ROOT`, `TIME_DATASET`, `TIME_METADATA`, `TIME_WEIGHTS`,
  `TIME_OUTPUTS`, and `TIME_LOGS` path contract and ignored local placeholders.
- Added a revision-pinned, resumable downloader and saved-Arrow validation for
  the official `Real-TSF/TIME` dataset.
- Added schema-1 task manifests, monotonic `run_n` allocation, exact-config
  skip/resume/overwrite behavior, interruption recording, explicit repeat and
  scientific-configuration selection, and selected-run pinning.
- Added explicit task-specific model fields to result selection. Reports may
  ignore a declared field such as Seasonal Naive's frequency-dependent
  `season_length` only when comparing different tasks; conflicting
  configurations for the same task remain an error.
- Added strict optional and required cross-experiment compact-result reuse.
- Added compact `metrics_summary.json` artifacts with finite and total metric
  counts while retaining raw per-window metrics separately.
- Added population standard deviation and variance on the same finite metric
  cells, preserving the existing arithmetic means and coverage.
  Seasonal Naive uses this same saver when creating its evaluation grid;
  focused coverage verifies that path. A model/Seasonal variance ratio uses
  Seasonal variance, not Seasonal mean squared. Temporary experiment refresh
  scripts and diagnostic evidence are not part of this maintained layer.
- Added reusable DGX/Selena runtime fronts, project-scoped artifact clearing,
  code/result synchronization, and publication helpers. Improved TIME owns
  their source but remains a non-executing parent with no cluster state.
- Made interruption recovery quota-resilient by marking task manifests before
  attempting the workflow-status rewrite, falling back to a direct manifest
  write on quota/full-filesystem errors, and honoring configured artifact roots
  when clearing Selena outputs.
- Added accelerator-synchronized inference timing that excludes model loading,
  dataset construction, metric computation, and result saving.
- Made resource diagnostics a shared cluster contract: every allocation logs
  visible accelerators, GPU and host memory, and explicit cgroup
  available/unavailable state, while model and CPU helper stages emit a common
  selected-device event for the device they actually use.

## Model and evaluation behavior

- Retained the common `chronos_bolt`, `chronos2`, `timesfm3`, `ts_icl`, and
  `seasonal_naive` adapters and removed incompatible or unused model surfaces.
- Made learned-model loading explicit and local-only, including TS-ICL's
  no-download path and the non-shadowing `run_timesfm3.py` entry name.
- Added explicit foundation-model target-mode and covariate capability checks.
  Chronos-2 supports native multivariate targets and past-target covariates;
  TS-ICL handles target channels as univariate batch items and accepts its
  supported known covariates; unsupported combinations fail.
- Aligned covariate missingness with ordinary backbone missing-value masks.
- Normalized TS-ICL's tensor and variable-length list return forms to TIME's
  `(batch, quantile, variate, horizon)` evaluation layout.
- Made retained Python runners fail on the first unsuccessful dataset.
- Removed stochastic Seasonal Naive resampling and pass deterministic
  StatsForecast quantiles directly into TIME evaluation.
- Corrected MASE so calendar gaps remain present and only finite seasonal pairs
  enter the scale denominator.
- Suppressed only the known pandas frequency-alias deprecations and preserved
  undefined all-zero MAPE/sMAPE cells without broad warning suppression.

## Data and feature behavior

- Corrected chronological training and validation endpoints, zero-validation
  handling, combined split validation, complete-window counting, and prediction
  instance-shape validation.
- Centralized missing-history forward filling and deterministic Seasonal Naive
  point forecasting.
- Added saved-Arrow feature input, per-dataset summaries, temporal and spatial
  location/scale/frequency heterogeneity, dataset ranks, and reusable
  feature-versus-performance calculations.
- Added a shared source/window audit using prefix counts for missingness and
  adjacent-value transitions for constant-window detection.
- Repaired `seasonal_corr` handling and its quadratic pair enumeration while
  preserving variates for which the optional statistic is undefined.
- Added a Seasonal-defined evaluation-grid contract shared by every model,
  strict finite-support enforcement, reusable shared or project-owned Seasonal
  Naive submission, and dataset-diagnostic cluster execution.
- Added reusable foundation summary, local leaderboard, and
  feature-performance reporting commands with external Seasonal-root support.
- Made reusable plotting headless and kept dense accuracy/time comparisons
  readable by moving more than eight labels into an external legend.

## Packaging and documentation

- Removed unused or conflicting dependencies and stale packaging declarations;
  aligned package and license metadata with the Apache-2.0 project contract.
- Corrected dataset-format, feature-output, evaluation-interface, and
  prediction-archive documentation.
- Kept feature/result joining and executable performance plots reusable, and
  made experiment model schedules override the complete parent capability
  registry without modifying shared execution code.
- Added dependency-light syntax, configuration, split, covariate, metric, and
  run-lifecycle contract checks.

## Deliberate downstream ownership

Improved TIME owns generic foundation execution, Seasonal Naive, diagnostics,
evaluation grids, reporting, Slurm runtime, synchronization, publication, and
status implementations. Downstream repositories own their active scientific
schedules, comparison-specific launchers and utilities, scheduler resources,
artifact selections, result documents, conclusions, and all log/output
payloads. Improved TIME never executes or records those experiments itself.

## 2026-09-28 artifact-contract synchronization

- Standardized project-owned artifacts below
  `outputs/<surface>/<experiment>/...` and
  `logs/<surface>/<experiment>/...`, including experiment-owned reports,
  Slurm streams, Hydra state, stage logs, and workflow status.
- Run directories now use meaningful scientific identity and `run_n`; launch
  IDs and timestamps remain manifest or log metadata. `manifest.json` is the
  authoritative run configuration and lifecycle record, and allocation skips
  matching completed runs by default.
- Foundation evaluation now records explicit fallback and prediction-NaN
  metadata so compatible backbones can complete robustly without hiding which
  outputs required fallback handling.
